		<h2>About the Project</h2>
		<p>The proposed segregated cycle path from Dublin City Centre to Blanchardstown via Phoenix Park is a project aimed at improving cycling infrastructure in Dublin. The route will provide a safe and convenient way for cyclists to travel from the city centre to Blanchardstown, passing through the beautiful Phoenix Park along the way.</p>
	</section>
	<section id="route">
		<h2>The Route</h2>
		<p>The proposed cycle path will start at the intersection of Capel Street and Ormond Quay in Dublin City Centre and follow the River Liffey to the entrance of Phoenix Park. Once inside the park, the route will follow Chesterfield Avenue to the Castleknock Gate entrance and continue through Blanchardstown to the M50.</p>
		<p>The cycle path will be segregated from motor vehicle traffic and will feature dedicated cycle lanes and crossings at intersections. The design of the path will prioritize safety for cyclists and will be accessible for riders of all skill levels.</p>
